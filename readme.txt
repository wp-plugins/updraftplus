= Don't Risk Anything Less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to plugins with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backup or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

= UpdraftPlus Addons And Premium =

UpdraftPlus is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional, with no annoying omissions. What we do have is various extra features, and guaranteed support, available <a href="http://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>.

If you need WordPress multisite compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.

= Professional / Enterprise support agreements available =

UpdraftPlus is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a>

= More premium plugins =

If you are in the market for other WordPress premium plugins (especially WooCommerce addons), then try our shop, here: https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/

= Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate? =

Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="http://updraftplus.com/translate/">http://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

= Other support =

We hang out in the WordPress support forum for this plugin - http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus - however, to save our time so that we can spend it on development, please read the plugin's Frequently Asked Questions - <a href="http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/">http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/</a> - before going there, and ensure that you have updated to the latest released version of UpdraftPlus.

== Installation ==

<a href="http://updraftplus.com/download/">Please go here for full instructions for installing this plugin.</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<a href="http://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/"><strong>Please go here for the full FAQs - there are many more than below.</strong></a> Below are just a handful which particularly apply to the free wordpress.org version, or which bear repeating.

= Can UpdraftPlus do (something)? =

Check out <a href="http://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="http://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a>.

= I found a bug. What do I do? =

Note - this FAQ is for users of the free plugin. If you're a paying customer, then you should go here: http://updraftplus.com/support/ - please don't ask question in the WordPress.Org forum about purchases, as that's against their rules.

Next, please make sure you read this FAQ through to the end - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (e.g. buy our "No Adverts" add-on - http://updraftplus.com/shop/); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.

If it does not, then contact me (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the forum is the best way</a>)! This is a complex backup plugin and the only way I can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.

Please turn on debugging mode (in the UpdraftPlus options page) and then try again, and after that send me the log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, etcetera). http://pastebin.com is a good place to post the log.

If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send me multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).

If you are a programmer and can debug and send a patch, then that's even better.

Finally, if you post in the WordPress support forum, then make sure you include the word UpdraftPlus in your post; otherwise I will not be automatically notified that you posted.

= Anything essential to know? =

After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your WordPress backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.

= My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars! =

UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then go into the "Expert settings" and reduce the size at which zip files are split (versions 1.6.53 onwards). UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= Will you support Windows Live OneDrive (f.k.a. SkyDrive)? =

No. Microsoft forbid the use of OneDrive/SkyDrive by backup utilities - see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh826521.aspx ("Here are some examples of nonconforming apps: Apps that automatically back up files or folders to SkyDrive.").

= Any known bugs ? =

Not a bug, but one issue to be aware of is that backups of very large sites (lots of uploaded media) are quite complex matters, given the limits of running inside WordPress on a huge variety of different web hosting setups. With large sites, you need to use S3 (Amazon or compatible), Google Drive, Dropbox, WebDAV, Rackspace Cloud Files, DreamObjects (since 1.6.6) or FTP (since 1.5.9) because these support chunked, resumable uploads. Other backup methods have code (since 0.9.0) to retry failed uploads of an archive, but the upload cannot be chunked, so if an archive is enormous (i.e. cannot be completely uploaded in the time that PHP is allowed for running on your web host) it cannot work. (Though as far as we're aware, no other cloud backup plugins support chunking, so you're still no worse off than with the alternatives).

= My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you? =

No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.

= I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade? =

Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.

= Have you written any other free plugins? =

Thanks for asking - yes, I have. Check out my profile page - http://profiles.wordpress.org/DavidAnderson/ .

* TWEAK: Provide the error message sent by Google upon initial Drive authentication errors.
* TWEAK: Found a case where PHP's is_writable() erroneously returns true - actually test a write
* TWEAK: Use pseudo-namespacing on the CloudFiles library to prevent clashes with other plugins (pre-emptive - no known conflicts exist)
* TWEAK: Use higher priority on cron backup schedules call to prevent other plugins which call WP wrongly from over-writing new cron schedules (e.g. BackupBuddy)
