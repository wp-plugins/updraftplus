If these work whilst your scheduled backups and the \"Backup Now\" button do absolutely nothing (i.e. not even produce a log file), then it means that your scheduler is broken. You should then disable all your other plugins, and try the \"Backup Now\" button. If that fails, then contact your web hosting company and ask them if they have disabled wp-cron. If it succeeds, then re-activate your other plugins one-by-one, and find the one that is the problem and report a bug to them."
